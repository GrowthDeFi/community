## Proposal Details

### Adjustments to STKAPEMORBUSD-A

This will set the stability fee, the liquidation Ratio, and the liquidation penalty, in 25%, 110%, and 9%, respectively, for STKAPEMORBUSD-A.

### Prepare STKPCSBUSDUSDC-A for discontinuation

This will set the stability fee in 50% and remove the debt ceiling for STKPCSBUSDUSDC-A.

The goal is to discontinue STKPCSBUSDUSDC-A once all borrowers have closed down their positions.

### Decreases the liquidation ratio from 175% to 150% for selected ILKs

This will decrease the liquidation ratio (mat) from 175% to 150% for the following ILKs:

- STKCAKE-A
- STKBANANA-A
- STKPCSBNBCAKE-A
- STKPCSBNBETH-A
- STKPCSBNBBTCB-A
- STKPCSETHBTCB-A

### Surplus withdrawal of 50k MOR

This will be performing a 50k MOR withdrawal of the system surplus to the GrowthDeFi multisig wallet.

The MOR will be used to kickstart GRO/MOR and WHEAT/MOR liquidity before bonds are introduced.

### Instates a 24-hour mandatory delay to execute approved proposals

The delay contract parameter will be modified from 0-hours to 24-hours. This effectivelly imposes a mandatory delay of 24-hours to execute future proposals approved by the governance.
